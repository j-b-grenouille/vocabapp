You may create flashcards with a simple CSV file and import the core flashcards values to ReallyBasicVocab using the option in the app's menu.

The simple format has two variants you may use and combine as you please:

"front","back","notes"
"front","back"

If you add more columns the import fails.

The flashcards are stored in a auto created filing box and deck and may be integrated into the existing collection from there.
