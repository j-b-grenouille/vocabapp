If a list of flashcards contains more the 15000 flashcards the following limitations are applied to increase performance:

- If the setting to format flashcard front and back is activated: List display and search results are in some cases inaccurate. All possible characters for formatting (* and _) are removed from the flashcard front and back even if they are not part of the formatting.

Example: "*1* * 1" would normally display as "1 * 1" in the list, but now is shown as "1  1".

- Non-Latin scripts: Search may be inaccurate as the text is converted to lower case instead of being compared case-insensitive.
